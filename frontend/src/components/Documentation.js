</CodeHighlight>

                    <h5>Structure</h5>
                    <p>Sakai consists of 2 main parts; the application layout and the resources. <b>App.js</b> inside src folder is the main component containing the template for the base layout
                            whereas required resources such as SASS structure for the layout are placed inside the <b>src/layout</b> folder.</p>

                    <h5>Application Template</h5>
                    <p>Main layout is the JSX template of the App.js, it is divided into a couple of child components such as topbar, profile, menu and footer. Here is render method of the
                    App.js component that implements the logic such as menu state, layout modes and so on.
                        </p>

                    <h5>Menu</h5>
                    <p>Menu is a separate component defined in AppMenu.js file based on PrimeReact MenuModel API. In order to define the menuitems,
                    navigate to App.js file and define your own model as a nested structure. Here is the menu component from the demo application.</p>

                    <h5>PrimeReact Theme</h5>
                    <p>Sakai theming is based on the PrimeReact theme being used. Default theme is <b>lara-light-indigo</b>.</p>

                    <h5>SASS Variables</h5>
                    <p>In case you'd like to customize the main layout variables, open <b>_variables.scss</b> file under src/layout folder. Saving the changes
                    will be reflected instantly at your browser.
                        </p>
